## Description

Move this repository's Terva review from the terva-action-code-review v0.3.0 image to v0.5.0 (https://git.local.sothr.com/terva-sh/terva-action-code-review/releases/tag/v0.5.0), pinned by digest `sha256:64a7ba59ca8a0932e2b4d4cf8e50a2231f46fa6eaefa046acbef84f2a2886252`.

### What it gains

- **Up to 1 MiB of context,** not a fixed 256 KiB, so a large PR is reviewed rather than stopped at `context_limit`.
- **A change index** in every prompt.
- **Fallback models** from `TERVA_REVIEW_FALLBACKS`, now read by the workflow.
- **Decided findings** reach the reviewer.
- **A carry of every gate** in one dispatch.

Every profile digest and request key moves, so the first review of each open PR after this merges runs fresh. The allowlist, the concurrency group and the other settings stay as they are.

Part of terva-action-code-review TKT-01M3K5B2YX ('Move the consumers to the v0.5.0 image').

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The review workflow runs the v0.5.0 image by digest and reads TERVA_REVIEW_FALLBACKS
- [ ] A review of this change from its branch is recorded
